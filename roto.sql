This is due to the effect of the resin on the quartz itself.</li><li>This byproduct enhances the color of the slab and allows for a better polishing effect as a final result.</li><li>On lighter materials, and when this effect is not desired, the application of special epoxy systems allows the material to maintain its color.</li></ul></div></div>\"\r\n}]'),
